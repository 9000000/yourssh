# YourSSH

A professional, open-source SSH client for **macOS** and **Windows** built with Flutter. Designed for developers and sysadmins who want a fast, keyboard-friendly terminal experience with built-in SFTP, port forwarding, and secure credential management — all in a clean dark UI.

---

## Features

### Terminal & Connectivity
- **Multi-tab SSH sessions** with named tabs and per-tab connection state
- **Split terminal view** — horizontal/vertical pane splitting within a session
- **Port forwarding** — local, remote, and dynamic SOCKS5 tunnels
- **Local shell** — spawn native macOS/Windows shell alongside SSH sessions
- **xterm-256color** terminal emulation with full PTY support

### File Management
- **Dual-panel SFTP** — browse local and remote filesystems side-by-side
- Upload, download, rename, delete files and directories with transfer progress
- Breadcrumb navigation and file type icons

### Credentials & Security
- **Multiple auth methods**: password, SSH private key
- **OS-level secure storage**: credentials encrypted in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager via `flutter_secure_storage`
- **Known hosts verification**: interactive fingerprint trust dialog on first connect; persistent known-hosts database
- **Zero-knowledge cloud sync**: host configs encrypted client-side (AES) before syncing to Supabase
- **Vault** — encrypted local credential store for API keys, tokens, and secrets (biometric unlock)

### Productivity
- **Command snippets** — save and inject reusable command templates
- **Command history** — searchable history per session
- **Hotkeys** — customizable global keyboard shortcuts
- **Host groups** — organize connection profiles into logical folders
- **Broadcast mode** — send the same input to multiple sessions at once
- **Code editor** — edit remote files inline with a Monaco-powered editor

### Design
- Dark-only interface with a cohesive green-accent palette
- 7 bundled monospace fonts: 6 Powerline-compatible (DejaVu, Inconsolata, Meslo LGS, Source Code Pro, Ubuntu Mono, Roboto Mono) + MesloLGS NF (Nerd Font)
- Minimum window size enforced (800×600); fully resizable

### DevOps & Developer Tools
- **Network Tools** — ping, cURL, DNS lookup, traceroute, port scan, whois, netstat, disk usage, memory info, HTTP headers, SSL certificate inspection — all run on the active SSH session
- **Cloudflare Tunnel manager** — start/stop quick tunnels via `cloudflared` on the remote host; public URL displayed instantly
- **LAN Share** — serve any local file over HTTP for one-click download on the same network
- **Mail Catcher** — spin up a local SMTP capture server via SSH; inspect emails in a built-in two-panel viewer
- **MCP Server Gateway** — run an MCP server on a remote host and forward it locally for AI tool access
- **S3 Browser** — browse, upload, and delete objects in any S3-compatible bucket (AWS, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
- **AI Chat Sidebar** — toggle a Claude-powered assistant sidebar for command help and debugging

### Key Providers

| Provider | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `HostProvider` | CRUD for saved SSH connection profiles, persisted via `StorageService` |
| `SessionProvider` | Lifecycle of active `SshSession` objects; auto-reconnect logic |
| `LocalSessionProvider` | Lifecycle of local PTY shell sessions |
| `KeyProvider` | SSH key entries (path + passphrase) |

| `SftpTransferProvider` | Active transfer queue and progress tracking |
| `LocalFilePanelProvider` | Local filesystem panel state for dual-panel SFTP |
| `TerminalLayoutProvider` | Split-terminal layout (horizontal/vertical panes) |

### Key Services

| Service | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `SshService` | Owns `SSHClient` and `SSHSession` maps; connect, exec, shell, SFTP, disconnect |

## Cloud Sync Setup (Optional)

YourSSH can sync your host list across devices using a Supabase project as the backend. All data is **encrypted client-side** before leaving your machine — the server stores only ciphertext.

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Run the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` against your project.
3. Add your Supabase URL and anon key in **Settings → Sync** inside the app.
4. Set a strong encryption passphrase — this is the only key that can decrypt your data.

> Sync is fully optional. The app works entirely offline without it.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here's the recommended workflow:

### 1. Fork and branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Follow the existing patterns

- **Models** in `app/lib/models/` — immutable data classes with `copyWith`.
- **Providers** in `app/lib/providers/` — extend `ChangeNotifier`, delegate I/O to services.
- **Services** in `app/lib/services/` — pure logic, no Flutter widget dependencies.
- **Widgets** in `app/lib/widgets/` — stateless where possible; use `Consumer`/`context.watch` to bind to providers.

### 3. Code style

- Run `flutter analyze` — zero warnings expected before submitting.
- Keep comments minimal; prefer self-documenting names.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless essential.

### 4. Test your changes

```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze
```

### 5. Open a pull request

Include a short description of **what** changed and **why**. Screenshots for UI changes are appreciated.
